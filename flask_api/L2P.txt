It appears that the pendulum changes the direction of its swing over a period of around a day depending on how close to the north pole we are.   Actually what is happening is the penduum keeps swinging backwards and forwards in the same direction;   it is the earth that rotates under the pendulum","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se84vG6bzoA"

This graph shows excellent correlation between chocolate consumption and the number of nobel prizes a country has (both per capita).   Sadly it is unlikely one causes the other.  It might be pure chance.   It might be one common factor driving both;  e.g. people in rich countries can afford chocolate and also excellent education systems.","https://www.businessinsider.com/chocolate-consumption-vs-nobel-prizes-2014-4?IR=T"

Your phone is able to show you your correct location due to GPS satellites orbiting the earth and sending out very accurate time signals.   Your phone then has to use the precise locations of these satellites and tiny differences in the time the signal gets to your phone to calculate its position.   You can thank Gladys West for the maths which allows it to do this.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_West"

If we take a glass container with a vapour in it, say a cooled chamber with alcohol in it, then the vapour is transparent.   However when the particles emitted in radioactive decay pass through the chamber, they ionise the air particles and this creates an ideal 'nucleus' for the vapour to condense into a tiny droplet.   We can see the path of the charged particles through the chamber.","https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-uranium-emits-radiation-inside-cloud-chamber"
